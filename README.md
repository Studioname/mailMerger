Non-guided exercise for reading/writing files

The tutorial covered how to open files, and read/write/append. Also covered file destinations and navigating folders through code [../ for up, ./ for current]. The way i understand it is through postulating a gremlin in the folder containing main.py. You have to tell the gremlin to go up x folders by typing x * ../, or down some folders by ./first_folder/second_folder and so on.

Anyway, the exercise was unguided [after the initial tutorial] and went rather well. I also learned the value of stackoverflow. Seeing simply a single line - in my case, "file.write expects a string" - pretty much solved my entire problem, and I had fixed the code in not time. The line in question also helped me to understand the difference between file objects and strings, and that certain operations are only allowed on each. Which is a big step forward in understanding!
